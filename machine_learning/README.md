## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find any issues with the models, data processing, or performance, please [create an issue](LINK_TO_ISSUES). Provide detailed information about the problem, including:

- A descriptive title and summary.
- Steps to reproduce the bug.
- The environment (e.g., TensorFlow version, Python version) in which you encountered the bug.
- Logs or error messages.

### Proposing Enhancements

We welcome new ideas! If you have any improvements, feel free to open an issue. Please include:

- A clear description of the proposal.
- The expected outcome of the enhancement.
- Any relevant data or research to support the change.

### Contributing Code

Contributing to the Machine Learning section could include:

- Enhancing or fine-tuning existing models.
- Improving data preprocessing or feature engineering steps.
- Building new models or implementing new algorithms.
- Adding Jupyter notebooks for experiments and model evaluation.

To contribute:

1. **Fork the Repository** and clone it to your machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
   ```
2. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```
3. **Make your changes**, and commit them.
4. **Push your branch** to GitHub and open a Pull Request.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch** (depending on the model architecture)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for experiments)
- **Docker** (optional for consistent environments)

### Setting Up the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/original-repo/project-name.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Run your Jupyter Notebook or ML script locally:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   # or
   python train_model.py
   ```

## Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data (e.g., cleaning, normalization, encoding).
2. **Model Development**: Design, train, and validate machine learning models.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
4. **Experiment Tracking**: Use tools like MLFlow to track experiments and performance.
5. **Model Deployment**: Models should be saved and deployed using frameworks such as TensorFlow Serving or Flask APIs.

## Code Style Guidelines

- Follow the [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) coding style for Python.
- Document all classes, functions, and modules using docstrings.
- Include type hints in your function signatures.
- For data processing steps, provide clear comments about each operation.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure that all code is properly tested.
2. Add new or modify existing unit tests to cover your changes.
3. Check that the model training pipeline runs without errors.
4. Create a detailed pull request description that explains the purpose of the changes.
5. Link the pull request to any relevant issues by using "Fixes #issue_number."
